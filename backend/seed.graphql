      In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On Your Turn, you can enter a rage as a Bonus Action.
      While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren't wearing heavy armor:
      • You have advantage on Strength Checks and Strength Saving Throws.
      • When you make a melee weapon Attack using Strength, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll. This bonus increases as you level.
      • You have Resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
      If you are able to cast Spells, you can't cast them or concentrate on them while raging.
      Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked Unconscious or if Your Turn ends and you haven't attacked a Hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on Your Turn as a Bonus Action.
      Once you have raged the maximum number of times for your Barbarian level, you must finish a Long Rest before you can rage again. You may rage 2 times at 1st level, 3 at 3rd, 4 at 6th, 5 at 12th, and 6 at 17th.
