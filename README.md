# README

This is a rails app designed to keep track of DnD character sheets, items, NPCs, and general gameplay for the course of a campaign.
Users will be able to create and save multiple characters, the DM will be able to create and keep track of NPCs and everyone will be able to choose a game to join so that their stats are viewable to all other players.
